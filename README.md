- `m` - Switch speech recognition models
- `d` - Change audio input device
- `l` - View logs
- `h` - Show help
- `q` - Quit

## Models

ctrlSPEAK uses open-source speech recognition models:

- **Parakeet 0.6B (MLX)** (default): `mlx-community/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3` model optimized for Apple Silicon. Recommended for most users on M1/M2/M3 Macs.
- **Canary**: NVIDIA NeMo's `nvidia/canary-1b-flash` multilingual model (En, De, Fr, Es) with punctuation, but can be slower. Requires `requirements-nvidia.txt`.
- **Canary (180M)**: NVIDIA NeMo's `nvidia/canary-180m-flash` multilingual model, smaller and less accurate. Requires `requirements-nvidia.txt`.
- **Whisper** (optional): OpenAI's `openai/whisper-large-v3` model. A fast, accurate, and powerful model that includes excellent punctuation and capitalization. Requires `requirements-whisper.txt`.
- **Nemotron (Streaming)** [Experimental]: NVIDIA's `nvidia/nemotron-speech-streaming-en-0.6b` streaming model with real-time transcription. Text appears as you speak. Requires `requirements-nvidia.txt`.

**Note:** The `nvidia/parakeet-tdt-1.1b` model is also available for testing, but it is not recommended for general use as it lacks punctuation and is slower than the `0.6b` model. Requires `requirements-nvidia.txt`.

The models are automatically downloaded from HuggingFace the first time you use them.

### Listing Supported Models

To see a list of all supported models, use the `--list-models` flag:

```bash
ctrlspeak --list-models
```

This will output a list of the available model aliases and their corresponding Hugging Face model names.

### Apple Silicon (MLX) Acceleration

For users on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3 Macs), an optimized version of the Parakeet model is available using Apple's MLX framework. This is the default model and provides a significant performance boost.

## Model Selection

You can select a model using the `--model` flag. You can use either the full model name from HuggingFace or a short alias.

**Short Names:**

*   `parakeet`: Parakeet 0.6B optimized for Apple Silicon (MLX). (Default)
*   `canary`: NVIDIA's Canary 1B Flash model.
*   `canary-180m`: NVIDIA's Canary 180M Flash model.
*   `whisper`: OpenAI's Whisper v3 model.
*   `nemotron`: NVIDIA's Nemotron streaming model. [Experimental]

**Full Model URL:**

You can also provide a full model URL from Hugging Face. For example:

```bash
ctrlspeak --model nvidia/parakeet-tdt-1.1b
```

This will download and use the specified model.

```bash
# Using Homebrew installation
ctrlspeak --model parakeet  # Default
ctrlspeak --model canary         # Multilingual with punctuation
ctrlspeak --model canary-180m    # The smaller Canary model
ctrlspeak --model canary-v2
ctrlspeak --model whisper        # OpenAI's model
ctrlspeak --model parakeet-mlx   # MLX-accelerated model
ctrlspeak --model nemotron       # Streaming (experimental)

# Using manual installation
python ctrlspeak.py --model parakeet
python ctrlspeak.py --model canary
python ctrlspeak.py --model canary-180m
python ctrlspeak.py --model canary-v2
python ctrlspeak.py --model whisper
python ctrlspeak.py --model parakeet-mlx
python ctrlspeak.py --model nemotron
```

## Transcription History

ctrlSPEAK automatically saves your transcriptions locally for later review.

### History Browser

## Performance Comparison

| Model | Framework | Load Time (s) | Transcription Time (s) | Output Example (test.wav) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **`parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3`** | MLX (Apple Silicon) | 0.97 | 0.53 | "Well, I don't wish to see it any more, observed Phoebe, turning away her eyes. It is certainly very like the old portrait." |
| | NeMo (NVIDIA) | 15.52 | 1.68 | |
| **`parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2`** | MLX (Apple Silicon) | 0.99 | 0.56 | "Well, I don't wish to see it any more, observed Phebe, turning away her eyes. It is certainly very like the old portrait." |
| | NeMo (NVIDIA) | 8.23 | 1.61 | |
| **`canary-1b-flash`** | NeMo (NVIDIA) | 32.06 | 3.20 | "Well, I don't wish to see it any more, observed Phoebe, turning away her eyes. It is certainly very like the old portrait." |
| **`canary-180m-flash`** | NeMo (NVIDIA) | 6.16 | 3.20 | "Well, I don't wish to see it any more, observed Phoebe, turning away her eyes. It is certainly very like the old portrait." |
| **`whisper-large-v3`** | Transformers (OpenAI) | 5.44 | 2.53 | "Well, I don't wish to see it any more, observed Phoebe, turning away her eyes. It is certainly very like the old portrait." |

*Testing performed on a MacBook Pro (M2 Max) with a 7-second audio file (`test.wav`). Your results may vary.*

**Note:** Whisper model uses translate mode to enable proper punctuation and capitalization for English transcription.

### Streaming vs Batch Tradeoffs

The **Nemotron** model uses real-time streaming transcription where text appears as you speak. This provides instant feedback but has accuracy tradeoffs compared to batch models like Parakeet:

- **Streaming (Nemotron)**: Text appears incrementally during speech. Lower accuracy due to limited context - may miss or misinterpret phrases.
- **Batch (Parakeet, etc.)**: Transcription happens after recording stops. Higher accuracy because the model has the full audio context.

For most users, **Parakeet MLX** (default) provides the best balance of speed and accuracy.

## Permissions

The app requires:
- Microphone access (for recording audio)
- Accessibility permissions (for global keyboard shortcuts)
- Input Monitoring (required for keyboard event capture on macOS)

You'll be prompted to grant these permissions on first run.

## Troubleshooting

- **No sound on recording start/stop**: Ensure your system volume is not muted
- **Keyboard shortcuts not working**: Grant both Accessibility AND Input Monitoring permissions in System Settings
- **Transcription errors**: Try speaking more clearly or using the other model

## Release Process

This outlines the steps to create a new release and update the associated Homebrew tap.

**1. Prepare the Release:**

*   Ensure the code is stable and tests pass.
*   Update the version number in the following files:
    *   `VERSION` (e.g., `1.2.0`)
    *   `__init__.py` (`__version__ = "1.2.0"`)
    *   `pyproject.toml` (`version = "1.2.0"`)
*   Commit these version changes:
    ```bash
    git add VERSION __init__.py pyproject.toml
    git commit -m "Bump version to X.Y.Z"
    ```

**2. Tag and Push:**

*   Create a git tag matching the version:
    ```bash
    git tag vX.Y.Z
    ```
*   Push the commits and the tag to the remote repository:
    ```bash
    git push && git push origin vX.Y.Z
    ```

**3. Update Homebrew Tap:**

*   The source code tarball URL is automatically generated based on the tag (usually `https://github.com/<your-username>/ctrlspeak/archive/refs/tags/vX.Y.Z.tar.gz`).
*   Download the tarball using its URL and calculate its SHA256 checksum:
    ```bash
    # Replace URL with the actual tarball link based on the tag
    curl -sL https://github.com/<your-username>/ctrlspeak/archive/refs/tags/vX.Y.Z.tar.gz | shasum -a 256
    ```
*   Clone or navigate to your Homebrew tap repository (e.g., `../homebrew-ctrlspeak`).
*   Edit the formula file (e.g., `Formula/ctrlspeak.rb`):
    *   Update the `url` line with the tag tarball URL.
    *   Update the `sha256` line with the checksum you calculated.
    *   *Optional:* Update the `version` line if necessary (though it's often inferred).
    *   *Optional:* If `requirements.txt` or dependencies changed, update the `depends_on` and `install` steps accordingly.
*   Commit and push the changes in the tap repository:
    ```bash
    cd ../path/to/homebrew-ctrlspeak # Or wherever your tap repo is
    git add Formula/ctrlspeak.rb
    git commit -m "Update ctrlspeak to vX.Y.Z"
    git push
    ```

**4. Verify (Optional):**

*   Run `brew update` locally to fetch the updated formula.
*   Run `brew upgrade ctrlspeak` to install the new version.
*   Test the installed version.
